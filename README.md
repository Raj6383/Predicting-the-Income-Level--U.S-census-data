# Predicting-the-Income-Level--U.S-census-data

##Information:

In this project we analyze a U.S. census data taken from the UCI (University of California at Irvine) Machine Learning Repository. 
The project is divided into four parts: Cleaning and Preprocessing the Data, Exploratory Data Analysis, Predictive Analysis and Theoretical Background.
Our final goal is to build a model, which can predict whether the income of a random adult American citizen is less or greater than 50000$ a year based on given features, 
such as age, education, occupation, gender, race, etc.

##Data

Both training and test datasets are supplied along with the attribute names, have all been sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).
Both Datasets contain 15 variables (14 descriptive and 1 target), the dataset contains 32561 rows.
